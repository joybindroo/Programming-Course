## **Module 5: Advanced Topics**

[**Advanced Topics**](./Module5-Advanced-Topics.md)

* **File I/O Systems & Data Pipelines:**
    * Stream text/binary data, validate schemas, and ensure durability with atomic writes
* **Defensive Exception Handling:**
    * Build custom exception hierarchies, retries, and structured logging for observability
* **Concurrency and Parallelism:**
    * Compare threads, processes, async IO, and coordination primitives for throughput gains
* **Design Patterns in Practice:**
    * Apply creational/structural/behavioral patterns to real product features with trade-off notes
* **Web Development Deep Dive:**
    * Architect REST services, secure APIs, and ship responsive dashboards with CI observability

    * Evaluate native vs cross-platform stacks, offline sync, and telemetry-driven releases
* **Game Development Foundations:**
    * Implement game loops, ECS/state machines, physics, and asset pipelines for prototypes
* **Machine Learning & AI:**
    * Run the ML lifecycle—data prep, model training/evaluation, deployment, and drift monitoring
* **Systems Integration Capstone:**
    * Combine multiple disciplines (web, mobile, ML, realtime) into a documented end-to-end project

**Note:**

* **Language-Agnostic Approach:** While specific programming languages (like Python, Java, C++) will be used to implement concepts, the focus will be on understanding the underlying principles.
* **Problem-Solving and Practical Applications**
* **Continuous Learning and Community Engagement:**
    * Explore additional resources and participate in online communities. 
    * Foster a collaborative learning environment.
