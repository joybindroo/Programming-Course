    * Introduction to machine learning and AI concepts

**Note:**

* **Language-Agnostic Approach:** While specific programming languages (like Python, Java, C++) will be used to implement concepts, the focus will be on understanding the underlying principles.
* **Problem-Solving and Practical Applications**
* **Continuous Learning and Community Engagement:**
    * Explore additional resources and participate in online communities. 
    * Foster a collaborative learning environment.
