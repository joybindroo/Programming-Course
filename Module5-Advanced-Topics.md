# Module 5: Advanced Topics

This module introduces intermediate-to-advanced programming topics that broaden your problem-solving toolkit and prepare you for production-grade software.

## File I/O
- Understand file descriptors, buffering, and text vs binary modes.
- Practice reading/writing structured data (CSV, JSON) safely.

## Exception Handling
- Build defensive code that anticipates runtime failures.
- Learn try/except patterns, custom exception types, and cleanup blocks.

## Concurrency and Parallelism
- Compare threads, processes, and async event loops.
- Coordinate shared state using locks, queues, and task scheduling.

## Design Patterns
- Study creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
- Apply patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer) in small exercises.

## Web Development
- Explore client/server fundamentals and HTTP lifecycle.
- Prototype RESTful APIs and responsive front-ends.

## Mobile App Development
- Review native vs cross-platform stacks.
- Build simple views, handle navigation, and integrate device APIs.

## Game Development
- Implement game loops, input handling, and sprite-based rendering.
- Experiment with physics engines or frameworks like Pygame.

## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Cover supervised/unsupervised learning basics and model evaluation.
- Run small experiments using popular ML libraries.
